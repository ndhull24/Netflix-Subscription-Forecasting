# ## Process
# We will use Time Series Forecasting, we will estimate the expected number of new subscribers for Netflix, in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business.

# We will:
#     Step 1: Gather the historical Netflix Subscription data.
#     Step 2: Preprocess and clean the data.
#     Step 3: Explore and analyze the time series patterns.
#     Step 4: Choose the best model for time series forcasting model.
#     Step 5: Split the data and train the model using the training data to avoid             the overfitting.
#     Step 6: Forecast the upcoming Netflix subscription counts.

# ## Using ARIMA for Forecasting Netflix Quarterly Subcriptions
# 
# Let's start with Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA model to forecast the number of subscriptions of Netflix. 

# In[17]:


#Convert the data into time series format

time_series = df.set_index('Time Period')['Subscribers']


# Here we are converting the original DataFrame into a time series format, where the Time Period column becomes the index, and the Subscribers column becomes the data.

# In[19]:


#Lets find the value of p and q by plotting
#the ACF and PACF of differenced time series:

differenced_series = time_series.diff().dropna()

#Plot ACF and PACF of differenced time series

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize =(12,4))
plot_acf(differenced_series, ax=axes[0])
plot_pacf(differenced_series, ax=axes[1])

plt.show()


# Here we first calculated the differenced time series from the original time_series, removed any NaN values resulting from the differencing, and then plotted the ACF and PACF to provide insights into the potential order of the AR and MA components in the time series. These plots are useful for determining the appropriate parameters when using the ARIMA model for time series forecasting.
# 
# Based on the plots, we find that p=1 and q=1. The ACF plot cuts off at lag 1, indicating q=1, and the PACF plot also cuts off at lag 1, indicating p=1. As there is a linear trend in the subscription growth rate, we can set the value of d as 1 to remove the linear trend, making the time series stationary.

# In[24]:


#Lets use the ARIMA model on our data:

p, d, q = 1, 1, 1
model = ARIMA(time_series, order =(p, d, q))
results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())


# In[25]:


#Lets make predictions using the trained model to forecast the number of 
#subscribers for the next five quarters:

future_steps = 6
predictions = results.predict(len(time_series), len(time_series)+ future_steps -1 )
predictions = predictions.astype(int)
print(predictions)


# Lets visualise the results of Netflix Subscriptions Forecasting for the next six quarters:

# In[29]:


#Creating a DataFrame with the original data and predictions
forecast = pd.DataFrame({'Original': time_series, 'Predictions': predictions})

#Plot the original data and predictions
fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=forecast.index, y =forecast['Predictions'],
                        mode ='lines', name = 'Predictions'))

fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=forecast.index, y=forecast['Original'],
                        mode = 'lines', name = 'Original Data'))

fig.update_layout(title = 'Netflix Quarterly Subscription Predictions',
                 xaxis_title = 'Time Period',
                 yaxis_title = 'Subscribers',
                 legend = dict(x=0.1, y=0.9),
                 showlegend = True)

# ## Summary
# 
# Using techniques like time series forecasting, Netflix can estimate the expected number of new subscribers in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, ultimately contributing to their success and growth in the highly competitive streaming industry.
